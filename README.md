# Ann's Pans

## Description
A recipe website designed for ease of use, by my mother - a chef who has always wanted to write a cookbook but never had the time. While still in its infancy, the ultimate goal is to build a straight forward site with an easy to use admin page so she can input her recipes, which will then be saved to the database and automatically rendered to the page. As such the goal here is ease of use and simplicity so I optedf for a more traditional MVC approach with handlebars and a NoSQL database to handle the variable data structures that are recipes. 

## Background
My mother is not technology savvy by any means. She is just a chef who wants to write her own cookbook with minimal time and money expended. The reality of sitting down and publishing a book has always been too arduous and daunting for her to undertake. Filling out a webform once in a while, however, not so much.
